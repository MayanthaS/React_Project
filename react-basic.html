Sure! Imagine that you have a really smart robot friend. This robot can learn things, just like you do at school. When you show it pictures of cats and dogs, it can remember what makes them different and tell you which is which. 
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is like the brain of that robot. It's a special kind of computer program that helps the robot think and understand things. So, when you ask it questions or give it tasks, it can figure things out and help you with answers, just like a helpful buddy!
In short, AI is when computers or robots do things that usually need a human brain, like learning, solving problems, and knowing what to do next!
